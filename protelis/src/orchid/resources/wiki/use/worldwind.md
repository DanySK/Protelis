# Protelis running on NASA's WorldWind GIS

We provide [an example](https://github.com/Protelis/Protelis-Demo-Visualized) of Protelis running inside the
[NASA's WorldWind GIS/visualization framework](https://github.com/Protelis/Protelis-Demo-Visualized).

**NOTE:** the demo needs to get updated, see [Protelis issue #190](https://github.com/Protelis/Protelis/issues/190)
