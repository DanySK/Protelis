# Alchemist â™¥ Protelis

Alchemist is a simulator for pervasive computing, and supports Protelis since its early releases.
Actually, Protelis was first developed as a module for the simulator, and only in a second development stage it became a language on its own.
As a consequence, Alchemist is a good playground for operating with Protelis, it has been used with success in several scientific works.

# Quickstart

We provide a [**quickstart tutorial**](https://github.com/AlchemistSimulator/Protelis-Incarnation-tutorial) for using Protelis and Alchemist in combination.
Essentials:

* Alchemist simulations are defined in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) files.
Yaml is is a [human friendly and easy to learn](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/) data serialization standard.

* The tutorial relies on [Gradle](https://gradle.org) to resolve and download dependencies and configure the launch.
We recommend to use Gradle also for your project, if you plan to use Alchemist and Protelis in conjunction, the tutorial repository can be a good starting point.
Other useful resources can be found in the "Examples and demos" section, where several examples use the two tools in together.
However, they might be using a not-so-recent version, so your mileage with copy-paste may vary.
