This is an accelerated video showing a crowd dispersal application using the Alchemist simulator.
Each black dot is a handheld device, following real movement traces from the 2013 Vienna City Marathon.
Red dots are devices warned as being in dangerously crowded areas,
and yellow dots are devices warned that they are nearing a dangerously crowded area.
Blue dots represent people who follow the crowd dispersal applicationâ€™s advice.
